# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis — SQL Project

A structured SQL analysis of 1,100 e-commerce transactions, uncovering insights across revenue performance, product profitability, customer acquisition channels, and payment behavior.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores a cleaned e-commerce dataset using SQL queries to answer key business questions:

- Which products generate the most revenue?
- Which marketing channels drive the most orders?
- What payment methods do customers prefer?
